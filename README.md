# DataTracker

This project was used as part of a science class to aid students in distinguishing between precision and accuracy. As they went along, students could track an independent variable (mass) and as many trials as they need; the site kept track of the average value and standard deviation of each trial. I was experimenting with Angular, and tried to keep the whole project in as little code as possible.
